            <p> The way that this sight is layed out is similar to my own style of clean and simple. However it has accented movements with the scroll motion that add just enough for this simple sight to draw you in.</p>

    <p> This site is more for an exclusive event/confrence and isn't filled with too much content but just enough that you know who's coming, what the look like, where they're from, and if the ski or snowboard. The animation is yet again attached to your scrolling to change the text from the bottom and the image from the side.</p>

    <p> This is a fairly simple site, that has tried to put a bit of a hand printed feeling to it. There is some animation with the 360 degree can viewing and then the slight enlargement of the glasses when you select them. There aren't any drop down windows rather you can click on images to go to another page about that beer.</p>
